# Sean Mckeag's portfolio

I have created this portfolio to showcase my full-stack projects and professional skills in one place:

- the applications I built during the 24 weeks of the UCONN School of Engineering Full-Stack Web Developer Boot Camp
- all applications created after the Boot Camp


## The approach

I built an initial portolio during week 20 of the UCONN Full-Stack Web Developer Boot Camp using React.

I used conditional rendering to keep non-featured projects apart from the featured ones.


## Responsiveness, compatibility and accessibility

The application was developed with  mobile-first approach and is fully responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop.

The page was tested in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari iOS, and MacOS - where it looks and behaves identically.

Compatible for people using screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## Tech used

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- HTML5
- JavaScript ES6
- React
- Styled components
